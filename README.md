# ExpandableYT

This project shows how you can create a RecyclerView with 
expandable items using the new ConcatAdapter.Usually to implement 
this feature you would need to use a third party library and learn 
how to use it, and rely on the community to fix bugs. Hopefully this 
will be implemented in the new stable version of RecyclerView and 
will become a standard.
